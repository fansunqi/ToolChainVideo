After analyzing the extracted frames, it appears that the panda is not on the grass but on rocks. Therefore, the information provided does not directly answer why the panda on the grass is brown. To provide a clear answer, I will use the frame-extraction-tool again to extract more frames from the video.

================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the captions of the sampled frames, it is not clear how the people on stage react when the lady in green makes a dance move. To provide a clear answer, I will need to extract more frames from the video. Let's proceed with extracting additional frames to analyze the reactions of the people on stage.

Based on the extracted captions, it seems that the frames do not provide specific information about the woman's actions or facial expressions after opening the notes on her hands. To accurately answer the question about what the woman does after opening the notes, I will need to extract more frames from the video. Let's proceed with using the frame-extraction-tool to gather additional frames.

Frame 2691: two little girls sitting on a couch playing with a red ball
================================== Ai Message ==================================

Based on the captions of the sampled frames, it seems that the girls were playing with a box. Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is D. to play with the dog. If more information is needed, I will use the frame-extraction-tool to extract additional frames.
