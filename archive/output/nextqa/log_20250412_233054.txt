Based on the answers from the sampled frames, it seems that the reasons for the boy picking up one present from the group and moving to the sofa vary. Some answers suggest he did it to get a toy, play, or because it's a gift. There isn't a clear consensus on the specific reason. To provide a more accurate answer, I will use the object-tracking-tool to gather more information.
