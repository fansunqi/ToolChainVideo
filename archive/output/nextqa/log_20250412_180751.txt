Based on the analysis of the sampled frames, the man cycling does not try to sell the watch to the man in the trishaw by giving him a catalogue, showing him a video, showing him the watch, dismounting his bicycle, or giving him the watch strap. The answer seems to be that he doesn't try to sell the watch, or he does so by using it on his wrist. If more information is needed, I will proceed with extracting additional frames from the video.

Based on the answers from the sampled frames, it seems that the reason both buses suddenly started to drive off after stopping for a while could be due to an accident or the traffic light turning red. To provide a more definitive answer, I will use the frame-extraction-tool to extract more frames from the video.
