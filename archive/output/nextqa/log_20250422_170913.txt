Frame Selector: analysis: The sampled frames provide a sequence of actions involving the girl in white after she bends down. In Frame 0, she reaches up to pet the horse, while in Frame 29, she is actively petting the horse. By Frame 58, she stands up and walks away from a group, indicating a shift in her activity. Finally, in Frame 87, she is holding a small animal, which suggests a change in focus from the horse to another creature. The question asks specifically about her actions after bending down, which implies a need for clarity on her subsequent actions and interactions with the horse and possibly the small animal. 

The uninformed segment from Frame 88 to Frame 1070 is crucial as it may contain additional frames that depict her actions following Frame 87, potentially providing insights into her interactions with the horse or the small animal, or any other relevant activities that could help answer the question more comprehensively. Therefore, this segment is selected for further analysis.
