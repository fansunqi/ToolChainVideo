Suppose emily purchased some company stock in 2005 at a price of $50 per share. she passed away in 2020, when the stock's market value was $150 per share. if her heir, john, sold the stock in 2023 for $180 per share. assume the capital gains tax rate is 15%. according to the 'step-up in basis' rule, how much capital gains tax would john need to pay? Choose your answer from below options: A.$4.5 per share, B.$27 per share, C.$19.5 per share, D.$15 per share.

Visible Frames: add 9 frames to visible frames: [0, 1099, 2199, 3298, 4398, 5497, 6596, 7696, 8795]

ToolChainOutput: To determine the capital gains tax John needs to pay, we use the "step-up in basis" rule. This rule allows the heir to use the market value of the stock at the time of the original owner's death as the new cost basis.

- Emily purchased the stock at $50 per share.
- The market value at the time of her death in 2020 was $150 per share. This becomes the new cost basis for John.
- John sold the stock in 2023 for $180 per share.

The capital gain for John is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Capital Gain} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Stepped-up Basis} = 180 - 150 = 30 \]

The capital gains tax is then:

\[ \text{Capital Gains Tax} = \text{Capital Gain} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 30 \times 0.15 = 4.5 \]

So, John would need to pay $4.5 per share in capital gains tax.

The correct answer is **A. $4.5 per share**.
