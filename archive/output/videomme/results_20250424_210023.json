Therefore, the little finger is not the correct answer, as it does press a string. However, since all fingers mentioned are pressing strings, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. \n\nIf the question is asking which finger is not typically used in the Em9 chord, the answer would be the little finger, as it is not essential for the basic Em9 chord formation."
