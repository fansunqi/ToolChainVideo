What is the team's lac hitting percentage when the score is 38-29? Choose your answer from below options: A.48%, B.41%, C.56%, D.54%.

Visible Frames: add 16 frames to visible frames: [0, 1331, 2663, 3994, 5326, 6657, 7989, 9320, 10652, 11983, 13315, 14646, 15978, 17309, 18641, 19972]

image_grid_qa_output: I can't determine the team's lac hitting percentage from the images provided. You might want to look for any visible statistics or scoreboards in the frames that could provide this information.
