The slide discusses how MaMMUT leverages the encoder's learnt embeddings by combining them with fixed embeddings to enhance video understanding tasks. The related subtitle directly mirrors this explanation.\n\nA. \"functions but mmud already has learned\"\n- This option doesn't relate to the figure and doesn't address the integration of encoder learned embeddings.\n\nB. \u201cusually take some frame by frame\u201d\n- Similar to A, this option is not directly related to the integration of embeddings.\n\nC. \u201cpositional EMB adding sign s or cosine\u201d\n- While explaining the positional embedding addition, this option doesn't directly relate to the subtitle in the figure.\n\nE. \"you're going to get a very low value for\"\n- This option indicates a potential problem or challenge but doesn't address the integration of embeddings.\n\nOption D best encapsulates the integration of the video encoder\u2019s learned embeddings with fixed connections as described in the slide, making it the correct answer."
