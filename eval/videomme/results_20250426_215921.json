Roughly 30% of all northern Europeans were dying of TB, most of them were artists and writers - This statement is somewhat exaggerated and not universally accepted as fact.\n\nB. The consumption was thought to be only prevalent in white people - This statement is misleading; TB has affected various populations globally.\n\nC. TB was incurable - This statement is historically accurate, especially before the development of antibiotics in the mid-20th century.\n\nD. Southern California came to be known as \"the land of new lungs\" for the reason that the air there can heal TB diseases - This statement is based on historical beliefs about the health benefits of the climate in Southern California for TB patients.\n\nGiven the context of the question and the historical understanding of tuberculosis, the most accurate statement is:\n\n**C.

However, we can analyze the statements based on general knowledge about the themes often associated with Goya's works and the Fates in mythology.\n\nA. The extra man sitting among the Fates might be Goya himself - This statement could be plausible, as artists sometimes include themselves in their works.\n\nB. Clotho was holding the thread of life in the painting - This is consistent with the mythological role of Clotho, who spins the thread of life.\n\nC. The painting expresses Goya's helplessness and unwillingness towards his children's death - This statement could be interpreted as correct, given Goya's personal tragedies, but it is not universally accepted as a definitive interpretation of the painting.\n\nD. Atropos was carrying scissors, deciding whether cutting the thread of life - This is accurate according to mythology, as Atropos is known for cutting the thread of life.\n\nGiven this analysis, the statement that is likely **not correct** is:\n\n**C. The painting expresses Goya's helplessness and unwillingness towards his children's death.**\n\nThis statement is more interpretative and subjective compared to the others, which are based on established mythological roles."
