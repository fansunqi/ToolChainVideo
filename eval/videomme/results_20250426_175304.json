At the time, the Titanic met the legal requirements for lifeboats, even though there were not enough for everyone on board.\n\nC. People on the Titanic were not rescued in time because its operator was sleeping - This is correct. The nearby ship Californian did not respond in time because its radio operator was off duty.\n\nD.

Frame 5: Close-up of a nanobot or small device.\n6. Frame 6: Precision tool (possibly related to nanotechnology).\n7. Frame 7: Reference to oxygen and carbon dioxide (likely related to respiratory cells).\n8. Frame 8: Nanorobots in action (possibly related to haemostasis).\n9.
