- **B. Ask after-sales service for help if something happens to the computer and backup drive**: This is a viable option if both the computer and backup drive are compromised.

- **C. Download what they have backed up in the cloud if they have access to cloud service**: Cloud backups are a reliable way to recover files if local backups are unavailable.

- **D. Recover from the backup hard drives even if the drives get burnt**: This option is unlikely, as physical damage to drives typically makes data recovery difficult without professional services.
