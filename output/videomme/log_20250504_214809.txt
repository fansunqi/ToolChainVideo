image_grid_qa_output: To determine the correct chronological order of the parts of the video based on the provided frames, we can analyze the content depicted in the images:

1. **(c) Mice, plants, and cells**: This is likely represented in frames 9 (showing plant and animal cells) and 14 (showing bacteria), which suggests a focus on different types of cells and organisms.

2. **(a) Human lungs**: This is clearly depicted in frame 13, which shows human lungs.

3. **(b) Protein folding distortion**: This is likely represented in frames 1, 2, 6, and 10, which show various cellular structures and processes, possibly related to protein folding.

Based on this analysis, the most logical chronological order is:

- **(c)** Mice, plants, and cells (frames 9 and 14)
- **(b)** Protein folding distortion (frames 1, 2, 6, and 10)
- **(a)** Human lungs (frame 13)

Thus, the correct answer is **C. (c)(b)(a)**.
