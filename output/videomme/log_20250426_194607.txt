ToolChainOutput: To determine the order of events in the video, let's analyze the images:

- Image 8 shows nanorobots interacting with blood cells, which likely represents the use of nanorobots in cancer treatment.
- Image 12 shows a "RESPIROCYTE," which is related to respiratory cells and cardiovascular therapy.
- Image 13 shows nanorobots, which could be related to haemostasis.

Based on this analysis, the order is:

1. (b) the use of nanorobots in cancer treatment.
2. (a) application of respiratory cells to cardiovascular cure therapy.
3. (c) nanorobots for haemostasis.

Thus, the correct answer is B.(a)(b)(c).

Suppose emily purchased some company stock in 2005 at a price of $50 per share. she passed away in 2020, when the stock's market value was $150 per share. if her heir, john, sold the stock in 2023 for $180 per share. assume the capital gains tax rate is 15%. according to the 'step-up in basis' rule, how much capital gains tax would john need to pay? Choose your answer from below options: A.$4.5 per share, B.$27 per share, C.$19.5 per share, D.$15 per share.

Visible Frames: add 16 frames to visible frames: [0, 586, 1173, 1759, 2345, 2932, 3518, 4104, 4691, 5277, 5863, 6450, 7036, 7622, 8209, 8795]
Image grid saved to /home/fsq/video_agent/ToolChainVideo/misc/image_grid_results_6/grid_image_sample_20250426195244.png.

ToolChainOutput: To determine the capital gains tax John needs to pay, we use the "step-up in basis" rule. This rule allows the heir to use the market value of the stock at the time of the original owner's death as the new cost basis.

1. **Original Purchase Price (2005):** $50 per share
2. **Market Value at Emily's Death (2020):** $150 per share
3. **Selling Price (2023):** $180 per share

Under the step-up in basis rule, John's cost basis is $150 per share. Therefore, the capital gain is calculated as:

\[ \text{Capital Gain} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Stepped-up Basis} = \$180 - \$150 = \$30 \text{ per share} \]

The capital gains tax is 15%, so:

\[ \text{Capital Gains Tax} = 0.15 \times \$30 = \$4.5 \text{ per share} \]

The correct answer is **A. $4.5 per share**.
