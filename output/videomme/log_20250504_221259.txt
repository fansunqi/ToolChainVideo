image_grid_qa_output: I can't determine the exact level of magnification from the images alone. However, if the cells are clearly visible and detailed, it is likely to be a higher magnification. Typically, 1000x magnification is commonly used for detailed cellular observation. If the cells appear very large and detailed, it might be 1500x or 2000x. If they are less detailed, it could be 500x. Based on typical usage, I would suggest C. 1000x magnification as a common choice for viewing cells.
