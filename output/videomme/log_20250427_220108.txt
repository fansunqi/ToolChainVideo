The map in frame 5 shows ocean currents, and frame 10 highlights the Pacific Ocean. Frame 8 mentions Hawaii, indicating a westward movement across the Pacific.

Given this information, the most likely statement is:

**A. It will firstly be brought by equatorial current.**

This is because the equatorial currents typically move westward across the Pacific Ocean, which aligns with the information in the frames.
