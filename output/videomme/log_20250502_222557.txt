Choose your answer from below options: A.$4.5 per share, B.$27 per share, C.$19.5 per share, D.$15 per share.

image_grid_qa_output: To determine the capital gains tax John needs to pay, we use the "step-up in basis" rule. This rule allows the heir to use the market value of the stock at the time of the original owner's death as the cost basis.

1. **Emily's purchase price (2005):** $50 per share
2. **Market value at Emily's death (2020):** $150 per share
3. **John's selling price (2023):** $180 per share

According to the step-up in basis rule, John's cost basis is $150 per share. Therefore, the capital gain is calculated as follows:

- **Capital Gain:** $180 (selling price) - $150 (stepped-up basis) = $30 per share

The capital gains tax is 15%, so:

- **Capital Gains Tax:** $30 * 15% = $4.5 per share

Therefore, the correct answer is **A. $4.5 per share**.

The capital gains tax is 15%, so:

- **Capital Gains Tax:** $30 * 15% = $4.5 per share

How long did it take the first runner to reach the finish line in the third race in the video? Choose your answer from below options: A.55 seconds, B.54 seconds, C.53 seconds, D.2 minutes and 29 seconds.

image_grid_qa_output: To determine how long it took the first runner to reach the finish line in the third race, we need to identify the relevant frames and timestamps.

1. **Frame 9** shows the start of the third race with a timestamp of 00:41.
2. **Frame 12** shows the finish of the third race with a timestamp of 01:25.

Subtracting the start time from the finish time gives us:

01:25 - 00:41 = 44 seconds

However, this doesn't match any of the given options. Let's re-evaluate:

- The third race might have started at a different point, or the finish might be shown in a different frame. 
- **Frame 11** shows a timestamp of 00:34, which might be the start of the third race.
- **Frame 12** shows the finish at 01:25.

Subtracting these gives:

01:25 - 00:34 = 51 seconds

This still doesn't match the options. Let's consider the possibility of a misalignment in the sequence or a different interpretation:

- **Frame 14** shows a timestamp of 04:14, which might be the finish of a different race.

Re-evaluating the sequence, the correct answer based on the options provided is likely **C. 53 seconds**, assuming a possible oversight in the frame sequence or timestamp interpretation.

13. Images 15 and 16 show aerial views of a coastal area.

Now, let's evaluate the statements:

A. The cargo in the lost port might be transported to Rome by the natural channel of the Tiber River.
- Supported by images 5 and 6, which show water bodies that could be the Tiber River.

B. At its peak, the Roman Empire's territory encompassed parts of Asia, most of Europe, and a portion of North Africa.
- This is a historical fact and not directly related to the images.

C. Experts guess there may be a port near Rome because there are records about it and the vast food need of Rome.
- Supported by images 4, 8, and 12, which suggest archaeological exploration and coastal areas.

D. The hexagonal lake was probably used for unloading cargo.
- There is no clear evidence of a hexagonal lake in the images.

Based on the image sequence, the statement that is not correct is likely:

**D. The hexagonal lake was probably used for unloading cargo.**

- **A. He is surrounded by enemies:** If there are multiple enemy champions nearby, flashing could be a defensive maneuver to escape.
- **B. He is in a hurry to go:** Flashing might be used to quickly reposition or reach a strategic location.
- **C. The cost of flash is low:** Flash is a valuable summoner spell with a long cooldown, so this is unlikely.
- **D. He wants to attack the enemy:** Flashing over a wall could be an aggressive move to surprise or engage an enemy.

Without more context, it's difficult to choose the correct option.
