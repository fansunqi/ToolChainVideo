Question: How do the two man play the instrument? Choose your answer from below options: A.roll the handle, B.tap their feet, C.strum the string, D.hit with sticks, E.pat with hand.

Please strictly follow the rules below while using the tools:
Rule 1: Do not use the frame-extraction-tool as the first tool. 
Rule 2: If, after using other tools, you still do not have enough information to provide a clear answer, you must use the frame-extraction-tool to extract more frames from the video.
Rule 3: After using the frame-extraction-tool, please continue with other tools to analyze the extracted frames."
Rule 4: The same tool should not be invoked consecutively.
