The toy car hit the wall**: The video does not show any visual content related to a toy car hitting the wall, so this option is not the reason for the man throwing the plane first.\n\n- **C. Put on earmuffs**: The video does not include any subtitles or visual content related to putting on earmuffs, so this option is not the reason for the man throwing the plane first.\n\n- **D.
