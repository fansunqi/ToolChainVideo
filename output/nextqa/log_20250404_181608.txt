Regarding a given video, use tools to answer the following question as best you can.

Questions: How many children are in the video? Choose your answer from below selections: A.one, B.three, C.seven, D.two, E.five.

Here are some rules of calling tools:
- Before using other tools to access the instancedb SQLite database, you must first call the 'VideoInstanceUnderstanding' tool to construct the instancedb database.
- Before using other tools to access the temporaldb SQLite database, you must first call the 'VideoTemporalUnderstanding' tool to construct the temporaldb database.
- Therefore, your first step must be to call either the 'VideoInstanceUnderstanding' tool or the 'VideoTemporalUnderstanding' tool.
- The 'VideoInstanceUnderstanding' tool and the 'VideoTemporalUnderstanding' tool only need to be called once and do not need to be called repeatedly.
