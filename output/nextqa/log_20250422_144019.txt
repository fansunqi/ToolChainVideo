This technique is often used by skiers when they are learning or facing challenging conditions, such as deep snow or uneven terrain.


Question:
Why did the man remove one of his skates before standing up? Choose your answer from below options: A.counting beats, B.hit sofa, C.take something, D.pick it up, E.to get better balance.


Summarizer Output Answer:  E. to get better balance

ToolChainOutput: ['Based on the images, it seems the man removed one of his skates before standing up to get better balance. The snowy and uneven terrain likely makes it difficult to stand with skates on, so removing one would help stabilize himself. Therefore, the answer is E: to get better balance.', 'E. to get better balance', 'E.to get better balance.']
