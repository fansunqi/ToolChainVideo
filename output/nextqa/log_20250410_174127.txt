Based on the additional frames extracted and their captions, the reason why the man has to throw the plane first in the middle of the video is to get it to start flying. The frames show a young boy holding a remote control in a field, playing with a frisbee, and a man and a child playing with a frisbee in the park, indicating a scenario where the man is likely trying to get the plane to start flying.

After analyzing the additional frames, it seems that the baby grabbing the man's ear and hair was likely a playful interaction between the two. The baby appears to be in a playful and affectionate mood while being held by the man. The action may have been a way for the baby to engage with the man in a fun and interactive manner. Therefore, the most suitable answer to the question would be "B. play with the man."

Based on the captions of the sampled frames, it is evident that the divers are underwater with scuba equipment. The bubbles coming from the diver's mouth are likely due to them breathing underwater using scuba gear, which involves the release of excess oxygen as bubbles. Therefore, the correct answer is E. they are breathing.

Based on the captions of the sampled frames, it appears that the men in black are working on ladders and using them to reach, climb, and lift objects. This suggests that they are holding onto the metal as part of their performance rather than for other reasons like testing strength or supporting a metal structure. Therefore, the answer to the question is likely C. part of performance.
