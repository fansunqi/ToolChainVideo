Based on the newly extracted frames, the man in white was holding tightly to the boy in white in a setting where there were a lot of people standing around a small boy. This suggests that the man may have been holding the boy to prevent him from falling off or to ensure his safety in a crowded environment. Therefore, the most likely reason for the man holding tightly to the boy is to prevent falling off.

Based on the sampled frames, it appears that the baby is eating a banana. The possible reasons for the baby putting his other hand on the fruit after a while could be to hold tight, to be more comfortable, to make it less messy, or to pull the fruit out. To provide a more accurate answer, I will use the frame-extraction-tool to extract more frames from the video.

Based on the additional frames extracted, it is evident that the baby is consistently eating a banana. The reason the baby put his other hand on the fruit after a while of putting it in his mouth could be to hold tight, to be more comfortable, to make it less messy, or to pull the fruit out. To provide a definitive answer, I would suggest considering the option of "to make it less messy" as the baby may have been trying to prevent any mess while eating the fruit.
