Question: How did the guy on the board managed to not fall off from the board at the start of the video? Choose your answer from below options: A.jump, B.nod, C.push the chair away, D.playing the piano, E.move left right to balance.

Please strictly follow the rules below while using the tools:
Rule 1: Do not use the frame-extraction-tool as the first tool. 
Rule 2: If, after using other tools, you still do not have enough information to provide a clear answer, you must use the frame-extraction-tool to extract more frames from the video.
Rule 3: After using the frame-extraction-tool, please continue with other tools to analyze the extracted frames."
Rule 4: The same tool should not be invoked consecutively.

Based on the captions of the sampled frames, the guy on the board at the start of the video is riding a wave on a surfboard in a pool. The captions do not provide specific information on how he managed to not fall off from the board. To gather more information to answer the question accurately, I will use the frame-extraction-tool.
