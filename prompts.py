Rule 1: Do not use the frame-extraction-tool as the first tool. 
Rule 2: If, after using other tools, you still do not have enough information to provide a clear answer, you must use the frame-extraction-tool to extract more frames from the video.

SELECT_FRAMES_PROMPT = """Given a video that has {num_frames} frames, the frames are decoded at {fps} fps. 

Given the following information of sampled frames in the video:
```
{visible_frames_info}
```

To answer the following question: 
``` 
{question}
```

However, the information in the initial sampled frames is not suffient. Our goal is to identify additional frames that contain crucial information necessary for answering the question. These frames should not only address the query directly but should also complement the insights gleaned from the descriptions of the initial frames.

To achieve this, we will:

1. List the uninformed video segments between sampled frames in the format 'segment_id': 'start_frame_index'-'end_frame_index': 
```
{candidate_segment}
```

2. Determine which segments are likely to contain frames that are most relevant to the question. These frames should capture key visual elements, such as objects, humans, interactions, actions, and scenes, that are supportive to answer the question.

Return the selected video segments in json format:
<analysis>: Describe the known information of sampled frames first. Then analyze the question and select the most relevant uninformed video segment.
<segments>: List of segment ids of selected video segments, i.e., list of integers in [0, {max_candidate_segment_id}].

Instructions:
1. First describe what you see in each of the five regions.
2. Then select the most relevant region(s) to answer the question.
3. Choose only the minimum necessary regions - avoid selecting redundant areas that show the same content. For example, if one patch contains the entire object(s), do not select another patch that only shows a part of the same object(s).
